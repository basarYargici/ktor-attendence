# KTOR - Attendance

This project's goal was to take attendance at our event and gain experience with KTOR, but it did not need to be
completed because the requirements changed. As a result, I didn't need to use methods like POST, DELETE or think about
on the UI/UX experience. I have just finished my first project with KTOR with this purpose :smile:
